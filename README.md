# SHAREWITHWORLD IS A SOCIAL APP CREATED USING REACT, FIREBASE, MATERIAL UI, REACT ROUTER V6

# THIS IS MY FIRST PROJECT THAT INVOLVES WORKING WITH A DATABASE, AND SOME OF THE DIFFICULTIES I FACED INCLUDE: 

## CREATING USER AUTHENTICATION.
## USING FIREBASE FIRESTORE FOR STORING THE ENTIRE POST, USER INFORMATION AND FIREBASE STORAGE FOR STORING THE IMAGES.

# HOW I WAS ABLE TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS I ENCOUNTERED:

## I PRETTY MUCH JUST WATCHED SOME TUTORIALS ON YOUTUBE, READ THE FIREBASE DOCUMENTATION AND USED MY INTUITION.

# CONCLUSION
## OVERALL, THIS WAS A PRETTY CHALLANGING PROJECT, BUT IT WAS EXCITING TO WORK ON AND IT DEFINITELY TAUGHT ME ALOT.
